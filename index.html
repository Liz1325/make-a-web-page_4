<h1>Introduction to Programming Notes</h1>
<h2><span>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web</h2><span>
<p>
   Overview of the Internet - The internet  is comprised of the web, HTML, URLs, HTTP, and 
   the web applications.
</p>
<p>
  Introduction to HTML -  Introduction of HTML tags, even though these tags aren't visible to users of a web
  page, they stilll carry meaning that is meaningful to web browsers.
</p>
<p>
  How Coding Works - Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.  The
  computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.
</p>
<p>
  Computers are Stupid - Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer would understand this is known as the correct syntax.  Programmer's cannot remember everyting - there are too many detals to keep everything in your head.  If you forget how to do something in HTML you can always look it up
</p>
<p><b>Basic HTML vocabulary:</b></p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>
    Tag:  An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets.      Most tags have an opening and a closing tag.
  </li>
  <li>
    Element:  An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
  </li>
  <li>
    Attribute: Is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the element's opening tag.  All attributes are made up of two parts, a <b>name</b> and a <b> value.</b>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Lesson 2:  Creating a Structured Document with HTML</span></h2>
<p>
    HTML and CSS are both"languages."  HTML controls the "structure" of  a web page.  CSS controls the "style" of   a page (how it looks).  When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the   tree-like structure of a page.  Developer tools are available on a browser and allow you to see the structure of the page as the browser interprets it.  Essentially the browser builds a tree-lie structure
</p>
<p>
  When you are looking at the structure on a page you will notice the sideways triangles, these are HTML elements. These elements can be text or it can be "span" or other kinds of tags.  HTML is the language of the web.  When you write in HTML you have to follow the HTML syntax rules, rather than the general gramatical rules.
</p>
<p>
  An element is created from the starting tag to the ending tag - and everything in between is content.  The content can be empty, it can be text, or it can be another element.  Each tag has a name or type that defins what kind of element will be created.  For example if you are putting paragraphs in you web page then you will need to define these paragraphs with correct tag; or if you are going to add attributes to certain parts of your text, then you will need to give an other element in addition to a class.  A document written in HTML defines the structure and content of the page. 
</p>
<p>
  To define style, you have to use another language that is called CSS.  CSS allows you to use another specific syntax and rules to change how elements lok on the page.  Things like the size of font, color, background, boders, positions, etc.  To tie style and structure together, the HTML document can provide the browser on what style to   use and where to get it.  
</p>
  <h2><span>Lesson 3: CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h2></span>
  <p>
  You can have several CSS files or sheets that will be referenced in HTML.  All of them will be used to fidn out the visible style for your own web page.  With CSS the most specific rule is applied to every element.  The concept of most specific rule applies to cascading.  You keep going down and down into the rules until you find the one that describes the element and then that rule is what gets applied.  
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance">Inheritance</a> is a key feature in CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    In CSS you first write what is called a "selector" this defines what elements of the page a particular style will apply to.  You can select an HTML tag tand that rule will apply to all tags on the page.  For example if you want to add a particular font to all the paragraphs this can be done by writing "p { }" within the style framework of CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another way to add style is to select elements by class. For example if you want to write a style that applies to the class "description" this is done by typing ".description { }" and insert the attributes inside the bracket.  In addition you define logical divisions within a document by adding the < div > element.  This means that when you use a < div > element, you are indicating that the enclosed content is a specific section of the page. It is typically used to position portions of the page.
  </p>
  <p>
    CSS helps to create a uniform look across several pages on a web site.  Instead of having to define each style for each block of text with a page of HTML, commonly used styles would only need to be defined once in a CSS document.  Once the style has been definced in the style sheet, it can bused by any page that references that CSS file. This avoids code repetition throughout your document. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/CSS/Reference">CSS Reference</a> pages can be found
    throught the web giving you all of the CSS properties you can use.  Think of CSS as adding style to headings too, similiar to how we can do this in Word, giving headings different styles.  In HTML you would identify each heading of your document by calling these tags as h1, h2, h3, etc.  In addition, you can also add border boxes with the CSS Style Box Sizing border, this would make both the border and lay-out.  I'm still a little lost on this part, so I'll have to do more research.  For now I used basic border CSS styles.
